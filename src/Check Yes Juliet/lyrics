Check yes Ju -- li -- et, are you with me?
Rain is fall -- ing down on the side -- walk.
I won't go un -- til you come out -- side.
Check yes Ju -- li -- et, kill the lim -- bo.
I'll keep toss -- ing rocks out your win -- dow.
There's no turn -- ing back for us to -- night.
Lace up your shoes.  Here's how we do.
Run ba -- by run, don't e -- ver look back.
They'll tear us a -- part if you give them the chance.
Don't sell your heart, don't say we're not meant to be.
Run ba -- by run, for -- e -- ver we'll be you and me.
Check yes Ju -- li -- et, I'll be wait -- ing.
Wish -- ing want -- ing yours for the tak -- ing.
Just sneak out and don't tell a soul good -- bye.
Check yes Ju -- li -- et, here's the count -- down:
three two one now fall in my arms now.
They can change the locks, don't let them change your mind.
Lace up your shoes.  Here's how we do.
Run ba -- by run, don't e -- ver look back.
They'll tear us a -- part if you give them the chance.
Don't sell your heart, don't say we're not meant to be.
Run ba -- by run, for -- e -- ver we'll be you and me.
Fly -- in' through the night we're fly -- in' through the night way up high.
The view from here is get -- ting bet -- ter with you by my side.
Run ba -- by run, don't e -- ver look back.
They'll tear us a -- part if you give them the chance.
Dont' sell your heart, don't say we're not meant to be.
Run ba -- by run, for -- e -- ver we'll be.
Run ba -- by run, don't e -- ver look back.
They'll tear us a -- part if you give them the chance.
Dont' sell your heart, don't say we're not meant to be.
Run ba -- by run, for -- e -- ver we'll be you and me.
