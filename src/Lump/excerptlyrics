% Lump sat alone in a boggy marsh
% Totally emotionless except for her heart
% Mud flowed up into Lump's pajamas
% She totally confused all the passing piranhas
Plump ra -- ges on in the un -- drained swamp
To -- tal -- ly cor -- rupt
A tic -- king time bomb
% She's lump
% She's lump
% She's in my head
% She's lump
% She's lump
% She's lump
% She might be dead
He's plump
He's plump
He can't stand straight
He's plump
He's plump
He's plump
He stirs up hate
