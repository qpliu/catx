"" "" "" "" ""
Zig -- gy played gui -- tar
Jam -- ming good with Weird and Gil -- ly and the Spi -- ders from Mars
He played it left hand
But made it too far ""
Be -- came the spe -- cial man
Then we were Zig -- gy's band
Zig -- gy real -- ly sang
Screwed up eyes and screwed down hair -- "" -- do
Like some cat from Ja -- pan
He could lick 'em by smi -- "" -- ling
He could leave them to hang ""
He came on so load -- ed man
Well- -- hung and snow- -- white tan ""
So where were the Spi -- ders while the fly tried to break our balls? ""
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched a -- bout his fans and should we crush his sweet hands?
"" "" "" ""
Zig -- gy played for time
Ji -- ving us that we were Voo -- doo
The kid was just crass
He was the naz with God gi -- ven ass ""
He took it all too far
But boy could he play gui -- tar
Ma -- king love with his e -- go
Zig -- gy sucked up in -- to his mind ""
Like a le -- per mes -- si -- ah
When the kids had killed the man I had to break up the band
"" "" "" "" ""
"" ""
Zig -- gy played gui -- tar
