I can feel it com -- ing in the air to -- night, - oh lord -
And I've been wait -- ing for this mo -- ment for all my life, - oh lord -
Can you feel it com -- ing in the air to -- night? - Oh lord, - oh lord - -
Well, if you told me you were drown -- ing, I would not lend a hand
I've seen your face be -- fore, my friend, but I don't know if you know who I am
Well, I was there and I saw what you did, I saw it with my own two eyes
So you can wipe off that grin, I know where you've been
It's all been a pack of lies
And I can feel it com -- ing in the air to -- night, - oh lord -
Well, I've been wait -- ing for this mo -- ment for all my life, - oh lord -
I can feel it com -- ing in the air to -- night, - oh lord -
Well, I've been wait -- ing for this mo -- ment for all my life, - oh lord, - oh lord - -
Well, I re -- mem -- ber, I re -- mem -- ber, don't wor -- ry, how could I e -- ver for -- get?
It's the first time, - the last time - we e -- ver met
But I - - - know the rea -- son why you keep your si -- lence up, no, you don't fool me
Well, the hurt does -- n't show, but the pain still grows
It's no stran -- ger to you and me
I can feel it com -- ing in the air to -- night, - oh lord -
Well, I've been wait -- ing for this mo -- ment for all my life, - oh lord -
I can feel it in the air to -- night, - oh lord, - oh lord -
Well, I've been wait -- ing for this mo -- ment for all my life, - oh lord -
I can feel it com -- ing in the air to -- night, - oh lord -
And I've been wait -- ing for this mo -- ment for all - my life, - - - oh lord - -
I can feel it in the air to -- night, oh lord, - - - oh lord, - - - oh lord - -
Well, I've been wait -- ing for this mo -- ment all - - my life, - - - - oh lord, - oh lord -
I can feel it in the air - to -- night, oh lord, - - oh lord, - oh lord, -
Well, I've been wait -- ing for this mo -- ment all - my life, - - - - oh lord, - oh lord -
