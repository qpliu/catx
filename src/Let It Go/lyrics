The snow glows white on the moun-tain to-night,
Not a foot-print to be seen.
A king-dom of i-so-la-+-tion And it looks like I'm the queen.
The wind is howl-ing like this swirl-ing storm in-side.-+
Could-n't keep it in, hea-ven knows I've tried.
Don't let them in, don't let them see.
Be the good girl you al-ways have to be.
Con-ceal, don't feel, don't let them know.
Well, now they know.
Let it go, let it go.
Can't-+ hold it back a-ny-more.
Let it go, let it go.-+
Turn a-way and slam-+ the-+ door.-+
I don't care what they're go-ing to say.
Let the storm rage on.
The cold ne-ver bo-thered me a-ny-way.
It's fun-ny how some dis-tance makes e-very-thing seem-+ small.
And the fears that once con-troll-ed me can't get to me-+ at all.
It's time to see what I can do.
To test the li-mits and break through.
No right, no wrong, no rules for me.
I'm free.
Let it go, let it go.
I am one with the wind and sky.-+-+
Let it go, let it go.-+
You'll ne-ver see-+ me-+ cry.-+
Here I stand and here I stay.
Let the storm rage on.
My po-wer flur-ries through the air in-to the ground.
My soul is spi-ral-ing in fro-zen frac-tals all a-+-round.-+
And one thought crys-tal-liz-es like an i-cy blast.
I'm ne-ver go-ing back, the past is in the past.
Let it go, let it go.
And I'll rise like the break of dawn.-+-+
Let it go, let it go.-+
That per-fect girl-+ is-+ gone.-+
Here I stand in the light-+ of day.-+-+-+
Let the storm rage on.
Cold ne-ver bo-ther-ed me a-ny-way.
