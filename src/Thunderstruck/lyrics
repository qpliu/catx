Thun -- der, thun -- der, 
Thun -- der, thun -- der, thun -- der, thun -- der, 
Thun -- der, thun -- der, thun -- der, thun -- der, 
I was caught
In the mid -- dle of a rail -- road track __
I looked round
And I knew there was no turn -- ing back
My mind raced
And I thought what could __ I do
And I knew
There was no help, no help from you __
Sound of the drums
Beating in my heart
The thun -- der of guns
Tore me a -- part
You've been
Thun -- der -- struck
Rode down the high -- way
Broke the limit, we hit the town __
Went through to Tex -- as, ye -- ah Tex -- as, and we had some fun
We met some girls
Some dan -- cers who gave a good time __
Broke all the rules
Played all the fools
Yeah they, they, they blew our minds
And I was shaking at the knees
Could I come a -- gain please
Yeah them la -- dies were too kind
You've been
Thun -- der -- struck
I was sha -- king at the knees
Could I come a -- gain please
Thun -- der -- struck, 
Thun -- der -- struck, 
Thun -- der -- struck, 
Thun -- der -- struck
It's al -- right, we're doin' fine
It's al -- right, we're doin' fine, fine, fine
Thun -- der -- struck, yeah, yeah, yeah
Thun -- der -- struck, Thun -- der -- struck
Thun -- der -- struck, ba -- by, ba -- by
Thun -- der -- struck, you've been Thun -- der -- struck
Thun -- der -- struck, Thun -- der -- struck
You've been Thun -- der -- struck
