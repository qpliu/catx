Thun -- der, thun -- der,
Thun -- der, thun -- der, thun -- der, thun -- der,
Thun -- der, thun -- der, thun -- der, thun -- der,
I was caught
In the mid -- dle of a rail -- road track _ 
I looked round
And I knew there was no turn -- ing back
My mind raced
And I thought what could _ I do 
And I knew
There was no help, no help from you _
Sound of the drums
Beating in my heart
The thun -- der of guns
Tore me a -- part
You've been
Thun -- der -- struck
Rode down the high -- way
Broke the limit, we hit the town _
Went through to Tex -- as, ye -- ah Tex -- as, and we had some fun
We met some girls
Some dan -- cers who gave a good time _
Broke all the rules
Played all the fools
Yeah they, they, they blew our minds
And I was shaking at the knees
Could I come a -- gain please
Yeah them la -- dies were too kind
You've been
Thun -- der -- struck
thun -- der -- struck _
yeah, yeah, yeah thun -- der -- struck 
You've been thun -- der -- struck
I was sha -- king at the knees
Could I come a -- gain please
Thun -- der -- struck, thun -- der -- struck _
Yeah yeah yeah thun -- der -- struck 
You've been thun -- der -- struck
Yeah, yeah, yeah, _ yeah
It's al -- right,  
we're do -- in' fine, 
Yeah, It's al -- right,  
we're do -- in' fine, fine 
fine, fine, 
Thun -- der -- struck, thun -- der -- struck _ 
yeah, yeah, yeah
Thun -- der -- struck, _
You've been Thun -- der -- struck
