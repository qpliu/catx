Show me, show me, show me how you do that trick.
The one that makes me scream, she said.
The one that makes me laugh, she said.
And threw her arms a-round my neck.
Show me how you do it, and I pro-mise you I pro-mise that I'll run a-way with you.
I'll run a-way with you.

Spin-ning on that diz-zy edge.
Kissed her face and kissed her-+ head.
Dreamed-+ of all the diffe-rent ways I had to make her glow.

Why are you so far a-way?, she said.
Why won't you e-ver know that I'm in love with you?
That I'm in love with you?

You,-+-+ soft and on-ly.
You,-+-+ lost and lone-ly.
You,-+-+ strange as an-gels dan-cing in the deep-est o-ceans twis-ting in the wa-ter.
You're just like a dream.
You're just like a dream.

Day-light licked me in-to shape.
I must have been a-sleep for days.
And mov-ing lips to breathe her name.
I o-pened up my eyes and found my-self a-lone, a-lone a-lone a-bove a rag-ing sea
that stole the on-ly girl I loved and drowned her deep in-side of me.

You,-+-+ soft and on-ly.
You,-+-+ lost and lone-ly.
You,-+-+ just like hea-ven.
