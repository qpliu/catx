Why can't I tell you all of these feel -- ings
It's so much ea -- si -- er when I'm dream -- ing
I think my brain's a -- bout to short cir -- cuit
I real -- ly wish I could find the words

And now I'm cry -- ing un -- der the moon -- light
I wan -- na call you up, but it's mid -- night
What should I do with all of these feel -- ings
Like a Ka -- lei -- do sco -- pic heart

The light that shines down from the moon
Will guide the way
And once a -- gain, it leads me to you

The con -- stel -- la -- tions spar -- kle in my dreams
And so I won -- der if it's a bless -- ing
As if by fate we're born on the same pla -- net
Just like a mi -- ra -- cle ro -- mance

So let us have a -- no -- ther great week -- end
And I will pray it has a hap -- py end
I'll still be here past, pre -- sent, and fu -- ture
Head o -- ver heels in love with you

I can't for -- get the way you looked at me that day
When I met you the ve -- ry first time
With -- in the sea of stars un -- der the night sky
I could still find you if I closed my eyes
I love the way the world gives us mo -- ments
That we make our own des -- ti -- ny

This mi -- ra -- cle will al -- ways re -- main a mys -- tery
Cause once a -- gain, it leads me to you

The con -- stel -- la -- tions spar -- kle in my dreams
And so I won -- der if it's a bless -- ing
As if by fate we're born on the same pla -- net
Just like a mi -- ra -- cle ro -- mance

She's the one named Sai -- lor Moon
She is the one named Sai -- lor Moon
