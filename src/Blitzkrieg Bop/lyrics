    Hey ho, let's go
    Hey ho, let's go
    Hey ho, let's go
    Hey ho, let's go
    They're form -- in' in a straight line
    They're go -- in' through a tight wind
    The kids are lo -- sin' their minds
    The Blitz -- krieg Bop
    They're pi -- lin' in the back seat
    They're ge -- ne -- ra -- ting steam heat
    Pul -- sa -- tin' to the back beat
    The Blitz -- krieg Bop
    Hey ho, let's go
    Shoot 'em in the back now
    What they want? I don't know
    They're all revved up and rea -- dy to go
    They're form -- in' in a straight line
    They're go -- in' through a tight wind
    The kids are lo -- sin' their minds
    The Blitz -- krieg Bop
    They're pi -- lin' in the back seat
    They're ge -- ne -- ra -- ting steam heat
    Pul -- sa -- tin' to the back beat
    The Blitz -- krieg Bop
    Hey ho, let's go
    Shoot 'em in the back now
    What they want? I don't know
    They're all revved up and rea -- dy to go
    They're for -- min' in a straight line
    They're go -- in' through a tight wind
    The kids are lo -- sin' their minds
    The Blitz -- krieg Bop
    They're pi -- lin' in the back seat
    They're ge -- ne -- ra -- ting steam heat
    Pul -- sa -- tin' to the back beat
    The Blitz -- krieg Bop
    Hey ho, let's go
    Hey ho, let's go
    Hey ho, let's go
    Hey ho, let's go
