Shot through the heart
And8 you're to blame
Dar -- lin', you give "" love "" "" "" a bad name
An an -- gel's smile is what you sell
You "" promise me hea -- ven, "" then put me through hell
Chains of "" love got a hold on me
When pas -- sion's a pri -- son, you can't "" break "" free
Oh, "" "" "" you're a load -- ed gun
Oh, "" "" there's no -- where to run
No one can save me
The da -- mage is done
Shot through the heart
And you're to "" blame
You give "" love "" "" a bad name %(bad name)
I play my part and you play "" your "" game
You give "" love "" "" a bad name %(bad name)
You give love, "" "" "" "a bad" name
Paint your smile on your lips
Blood red nails on your "" fin -- ger -- tips ""
A school boy's dream, you "" act so shy
Your ve -- ry first kiss was your first kiss good -- bye ""
Whoa, "" "" "you're a" load -- ed gun "" ""
Whoa, "" "" there's no -- where to run
No one can save me
The da -- mage is done
Shot through the heart
And you're to "" blame
You give "" love "" "" a bad name %(bad name)
I play my part and you play "" your "" game
You give "" love "" "" a bad name %(bad name)
You "" give "" love
Oh, shot through the heart
And you're to "" blame
You give love "" "" a bad name
I play my part and you play your "" game
You give "" love "" "" a bad name %(bad name)
Shot through the heart
And you're to "" blame
You give love "" "" a bad name %(bad name)
I play my part and you play your "" game
You give "" love "" "" a bad name %(bad name)
