    Some -- one told me long a -- go
    There's a calm be -- fore the storm. I know,
    and it's been com -- in' for some time
    When it's o -- ver, so they say
    It' ll rain a sun -- ny day. I know
    shin -- in' down like wat -- er
    I want to know, have you ev -- er seen the rain?
    I want to know, have you ev -- er seen the rain
    com -- in' down on a sun -- ny day?

    Yes -- ter -- day, and days be -- fore,
    Sun is cold and rain is hard. I know,
    - been that way for all my time.
    'Till for -- ev -- er, on it goes
    Through the cir -- cle, fast and slow. I know
    It can't stop. I won -- der.
    I want to know, have you ev -- er seen the rain?
    I want to know, have you ev -- er seen the rain
    com -- in' down on a sun -- ny day?

    I want to know, have you ev -- er seen the rain?
    I want to know, have you ev -- er seen the rain
    com -- in' down on a sun -- ny day?
