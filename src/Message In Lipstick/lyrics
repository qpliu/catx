    I have heard e -- nough
    a -- bout your in -- fi -- de -- li -- ty.
    So I'm on the train
    and you are re -- cent hi -- sto -- ry.
    Did -- n't take long
    for you to start to play and break all your so -- lemn pro -- mis -- es,
    the ones you make last week with your "\"I" "do\"."

    You've been be -- in' bad.
    And boy the ru -- mor tra -- veled fast.
    You can't change your ways.
    And I don't think our love can last.
    Why did you think
    I'd si -- lent -- ly take all your same sil -- ly im -- ma -- tu -- ri -- ty?
    I will scream and cry cause it's all true.

    I'm gon -- na tell your mo -- ther
    cause it hap -- pened a -- gain.
    I'll tell your bro -- ther too
    and you'll be oh so sor -- ry then oh yeah.

    May -- be you'll grow up
    when you go home and read the mir -- ror.
    I've left a lip -- stick mes -- sage there my dar -- ling.

    Call -- ing you some names
    is still a pos -- si -- bi -- li -- ty.
    Mak -- ing up with you
    for now is not a cer -- tain -- ty.
    Bet -- ter be -- lieve the things you read when you get home.
    And come back to re -- a -- li -- ty
    cause I'm go -- ing home to tell your mom.

    I'm gon -- na tell your mo -- ther
    cause it hap -- pened a -- gain.
    I'll tell your bro -- ther too.
    And you'll be oh so sor -- ry then oh yeah.

    May -- be you'll grow up
    when you go home and read the mir -- ror.
    I've left a lip -- stick mes -- sage there my dar -- ling.
    I've left a lip -- stick mes -- sage there my dar -- ling.
