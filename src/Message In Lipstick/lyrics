    I have heard e -- nough
    a -- bout your in -- fi -- de -- li -- ty.
    So I'm on the train
    and you are re -- cent hi -- sto -- ry.
    Did -- n't take long
    for you to start to play and break all your so -- lemn pro -- mis -- es,
    the ones you make last week with your "\"I" "do\"."

    You -- 've been be -- in bad
    And boy the ru -- mor tra -- veled fast
    You ca -- n't chan -- ge your ways
    And I don't think our love can last
    Why did you think
    I'd si -- lent -- ly take all your same sil -- ly im -- ma -- tu -- ri -- ty?
    I will scream and cry cause it's all true

    I'm gon -- na tell your mo -- ther
    Cause it hap -- pened a -- gain
    I'll tell your bro -- ther too
    And you'll be oh so sor -- ry then oh yeah

    May -- be you -- 'll grow up
    When you go home and read the mir -- ror
    I've left a lip -- stick mes -- sage there my dar -- ling

    Calling you some names
    Is still a possibility
    Making up with you
    For now is not a certainty
    Better believe the things you read when you get home
    And come back to reality
    Cause I'm going home to tell your mom

    I'm gonna tell your mother
    Cause it happened again
    I'll tell your brother too
    And you'll be oh so sorry then oh yeah

    Maybe you'll grow up
    When you go home and read the mirror
    I've left a lipstick message there my darling 
    I've left a lipstick message there my darling 
    　　(I'll tell your mother
	       I'll tell your mother...)
