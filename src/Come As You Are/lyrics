Come as you are, as you were
As I want you to be
As a friend, as a friend
As an old e -- ne -- my
Take your time, hur -- ry up
Choice is yours, don't be late
Take a rest as a friend
As an old me -- mo -- ri -- a

Me -- mo -- ri -- a
Me -- mo -- ri -- a
Me -- mo -- ri -- a

Come doused in mud, soaked in bleach
As I want you to be
As a trend, as a friend
As an old me -- mo -- ri -- a

Me -- mo -- ri -- a
Me -- mo -- ri -- a
Me -- mo -- ri -- a

And I swear that I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun

Me -- mo -- ri -- a
Me -- mo -- ri -- a
Me -- mo -- ri -- a
Me -- mo -- ri -- a

And I swear that I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun

Me -- mo -- ri -- a
Me -- mo -- ri -- a
