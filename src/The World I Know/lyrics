Has our con -- science shown?
Has the sweet breeze blown?
Has all kind -- ness gone?
Hope still lin -- gers on
I drink my -- self of new -- found pi -- ty
Sit -- ting a -- lone in New York Ci -- ty
And I don't-know-why
Are we lis -- ten -- ing
Hymns of of -- fer -- ing?
Have we eyes to see
That love is ga -- ther-ing?
All the words that I've been read -- ing -
Have now start -- ed the act of bleed -- ing
In -- to one,-in-to-one
So I walk up on high
And I step to the edge
To see my world be-low
And I laugh at my -- self
While the tears roll down -
'Cause it's the world I know
Oh it's the world I know
I drink my -- self of new -- found pi -- ty
Sit -- ting a -- lone in New York Ci -- ty
And I don't-know-why,-don't-know-why
So I walk up on high
And I step to the edge
To see my world be-low
And I laugh at my -- self
While the tears roll down -
'Cause it's the world I know
Oh it's the world I know
So I walk up on high
And I step to the edge
To see my world belo
And I laugh at my -- self
While the tears roll down -
'Cause it's the world I know
Oh it's the world I know
