Just a small town girl Liv-+-ving in a lone-lee were-old
She took the mid-night train go-in eh-knee where.
Just a cih-tee boy born and raised in South Dee-troit-+
He took the mid-night train go-in eh-knee-where.
A see-guer in a smo-key room-+
A smell of wine and cheap per-few-ume
For a smi-le they can share the night.-+
It goes on and on, and on, and on.-+ +
Strain-jers way-ting
Up and down the bou-le-vard.
Their sha-dows sir-ching + in the night. + +
Street-lights, pea-pole
Liv-ving just to find e-mo-shun.
High-ding some-where in the night,-+ +
Were-king hard + to get my fill,-+
Eh-very-bud-dee wants a thrill,-+ +
Pay-in eh-knee-thing to roll the dice-+
Just one more time.
Some will win, + some will loo ooze
Some were born to sing the blue ooze
Oh, the moo-vee neh-ver ends.-+
It goes on and on, and on, and on.-+ + +
Strain-jers way-ting
Up and down the bou-le-vard.
Their sha-dows sir-ching-+ in the night. + +
Street-lights, pea-pole
Liv-ving just to find e-mo-shun.
High-ding some-where-+ in the night,-+
Doe-ownt stop be-lee-eave-in'
Hold on to the feel-in'-+ + + +
Stree eet lights, pea-ee-pole-+ + + +
Doe-ownt stop be-lee-eave-in'
Hold-+ on to the-+ fee-eel-in'-+ + +
Stree eet lights, pea-ee-pole-+ + + +
Doe-ownt stop be-lee-eve-in'
Hold on to the feel-in'-+ +
Stree eet lights, pea-ee-pole-+ + + +
