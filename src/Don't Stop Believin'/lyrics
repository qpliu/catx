Just a small town girl Liv-+-in' in a lone-ly world.-+
She took the mid-night train go-in' a-ny-where.
Just a ci-ty boy born and raised in South Det-roit.-+
He took the mid-night train go-in' a-ny-where.
A sin-ger in a smo-ky room-+
A smell of wine and cheap per-fume-+
For a smi-le they can share the night.-+
It goes on and on, and on, and on.-+-+
Stran-gers wait-ing
Up and down the bou-le-vard.
Their sha-dows sear-ching-+ in the night.-+-+
Street-lights, peop-le
Liv-ing just to find e-mo-tion.
Hid-ing some-where in the night,-+-+
Work-ing hard-+ to get my fill,-+
E-very-bo-dy wants a thrill,-+-+
Pay-in' a-ny-thing to roll the dice-+
Just one more time.
Some will win,-+ some will lose.-+
Some were born to sing the blues.-+
Oh, the mo-vie ne-ver ends.-+
It goes on and on, and on, and on.-+-+-+
Stran-gers wait-ing
Up and down the bou-le-vard.
Their sha-dows sear-ching-+ in the night.-+-+
Street-lights, peop-le
Liv-ing just to find e-mo-tion.
Hid-ing some-where-+ in the night,-+
Don't-+ stop be-liev-+-in'
Hold on to the feel-in'-+-+-+-+
Street-+-lights, peop-+-le-+-+-+-+
Don't-+ stop be-liev-+-in'
Hold-+ on to the-+ feel-+-in'-+-+-+
Street-+-lights, peop-+-le-+-+-+-+
Don't-+ stop be-liev-+-in'
Hold on to the feel-in'-+-+
Street-+-lights, peop-+-le-+-+-+-+
