    Can you hear them?
    They talk a -- bout us.
    Tell -- ing lies.
    Well, that's no sur -- prise.
    Can you see them?
    See right through them?
    They have no shield,
    no sec -- rets to re -- veal.
    It does -- n't mat -- ter
    what they say
    in the jea -- lous games
    peo -- ple play, ay, ay, ay.
    Our lips are seal -- ed.
    There's a wea -- pon
    which we must use
    in our de -- fense.
    Si -- lence
    Spread -- ing ru -- mors
    so far from true,
    dragged up from the un -- der -- world,
    just like some pre -- cious pearl.
    It does -- n't mat -- ter
    what they say
    in the jea -- lous games
    peo -- ple play, ay, ay, ay.
    Our lips are seal -- ed.
    Pay no mind to
    what they say.
    It does -- n't mat -- ter
    A -- ny -- way, hey hey hey.
    Our lips are seal -- ed.
    Hush, my dar -- ling.
    Don't you cry.
    Cry -- in', an -- gel
    for -- get their lies.
    Can you hear them?
    They talk about us.
    Tell -- ing lies.
    Well, that's no sur -- prise.
    Can you see them?
    See right through them?
    They have no shield,
    No sec -- rets to re -- veal.
    It does -- n't mat -- ter
    what they say
    in the jea -- lous games
    peo -- ple play, ay, ay, ay.
    Our lips are seal -- ed.
    Pay no mind
    to what they say.
    It does -- n't mat -- ter
    a -- ny -- way, ay, ay, ay.
    Our lips are seal -- ed.
    Our lips are seal -- ed.
    Our lips are seal -- ed.
    Our lips are seal -- ed.
