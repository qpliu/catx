    Well, I won't back down
    No, I won't back down
    You can stand me up at the gates of hell
    But I won't back down

    No, I'll stand my ground
    Won't be turned a -- round
    And I'll keep this world from drag -- gin' me down
    Gon -- na stand my ground
    And I won't back down

    Hey, ba -- by
    There ain't no ea -- sy way out
    Hey, I
    Will stand my ground
    And I won't back down

    Well, I know what's right
    I got just one life
    In a world that keeps on push -- in' me around
    But I'll stand my ground
    And I won't back down

    Hey, ba -- by
    There ain't no ea -- sy way out
    Hey, I
    Will stand my ground
    And I won't back down

    Hey, ba -- by
    There ain't no ea -- sy way out
    Hey, I
    Won't back down

    Hey, ba -- by
    There ain't no ea -- sy way out
    Hey, I
    Will stand my ground
    And I won't back down
    No, I won't back down
